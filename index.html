            <h4>Design Inspiration</h4>
            <h5>Branding</h5>
            <p>We took an approach to develop the kind of agricultural/farming environment to present to our users, in order to feel welcomed and well at home. We sought to find visuals and colours to best keep the mood of the website displayed as a calming state for our users. We add various splashes of colour such as green to symbolize vegetables and crops. We decided to center it black with white for the font text colour to best capture appeal and legibility. We planned the structure of the visuals, colours and text used by organizing it on to a style guide and style tile shown below.

            <h5>Visual Lo-fi Prototype</h5>
            <p>Initially, each member of our team decided to create their own Lo-fi visual design prototype and we all took a vote to see which one looked more appealing to use for our final prototype. 
            </p>
            <p>Below you will see my own visual Lo-fi prototype I have done for the desktop version redesign of the homepage.

            <h5>User Test Feedback</h5>
            <p>After planning our layout, we developed a Mid-fi version of an improved functional prototype of Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada. We conducted usability tests after making a few iterations to it to finally evolve it into our High-fi Prototype (both a webpage and a mobile prototype).
            </p>
            <p>We took in the following input and observations during our second stage of testing for our Mid-fi prototype.
            </p>
            <ul>
                - Smoother navigation throughout site.<br>- Decrease of unnecessary links.<br>- Categorization of information and displaying a limited amount of options at once assisted the user.<br>- Aesthetically pleasing.<br>- Hover feature allowed for the user to be oriented to a specific link or secondary page.<br>- Simple layout bolstered a pleasurable experience for the user.
            </ul>
